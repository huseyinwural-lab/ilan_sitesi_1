# User Panel Soft Launch Plan

## 1. Phasing Strategy
We will not open the floodgates. We use a **"Invite-Only" -> "Public Beta"** approach.

### Phase 1: Internal Alpha (Weeks 1-2)
*   **Audience**: Internal team + 10 Friendly Users.
*   **Goal**: Find UX bugs in the Wizard. Verify "Draft" saving works reliably.
*   **Metrics**: Bug reports count.

### Phase 2: Individual Public Beta (Weeks 3-4)
*   **Audience**: 100% of "Individual" type signups in TR market.
*   **Restriction**: Dealers still use the old admin panel (or wait).
*   **Goal**: Verify load and conversion (Registration -> Published Listing).
*   **Metric**: Listing Completion Rate > 60%.

### Phase 3: Dealer Pilot (Month 2)
*   **Audience**: 50 selected dealers.
*   **Feature**: "Pro Dashboard" with bulk limits.
*   **Goal**: Verify "Dealer Analytics" value prop.

## 2. Rollout Checklist
- [ ] **Analytics**: Ensure `UserInteraction` events fire on every wizard step.
- [ ] **Support**: Setup "Intercom/Chat" for instant feedback in the panel.
- [ ] **Legal**: Update Terms of Service for "User Generated Content".

## 3. Success Criteria for Full Launch
*   Create Listing time < 2 minutes (median).
*   Zero data loss on browser refresh (Draft recovery).
*   Mobile responsive score (Lighthouse) > 90.
