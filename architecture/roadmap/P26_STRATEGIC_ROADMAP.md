# P26: Product Expansion Roadmap

## 1. Executive Summary
Following the successful launch of the Mobile App and ML Recommendation Engine, the next phase (P26) focuses on "Deepening the Moat" through community engagement and new revenue streams.

## 2. Expansion Vectors

### 2.1. Geographic Expansion (Q3 2026)
*   **Target**: Italy (`IT`) & UK (`GB`).
*   **Rationale**: High ARPU markets with existing diaspora overlap.
*   **Requirements**: Localization (it/en), Currency Support (GBP), Local Payment Methods.

### 2.2. Product Vertical: Services (Q4 2026)
*   **Concept**: Allow users to offer services (Cleaning, Moving, Repair) alongside selling goods.
*   **Synergy**: "Buy a sofa" -> "Hire a mover".
*   **Monetization**: Lead Gen model (Pay per Contact).

### 2.3. The "Next Big Thing": AI Chat Assistant (P27)
*   **Idea**: A conversational agent that helps users find listings ("Find me a red BMW under 20k near Berlin").
*   **Tech**: RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) using our `UserFeature` store and Vector DB.

## 3. Retention Strategy
To improve D30 retention from 20% to 35%:
1.  **Saved Search Alerts**: Push notifications for new matching items (High urgency).
2.  **Price Drop Alerts**: Notify users when favorited items get cheaper.
3.  **Chat Nudges**: "Seller replied to your message" (requires In-App Chat implementation).

## 4. Roadmap Decision
**Primary Focus for P26**: **In-App Messaging & Chat System**.
*   *Why?* Essential for retention and enables the AI Assistant future.
*   *Revenue?* "Verified Seller" badge, "Read Receipts" as premium features.
