# Search to Reveal Optimization Plan

## 1. Goal
Maximize the percentage of users who click "Show Phone" or "Send Message" after viewing a listing.

## 2. Optimizations

### 2.1. Trust Signals (Above the Fold)
*   **Verified Badge**: Show clearly next to Seller Name.
*   **Response Rate**: "Usually replies in 1 hour" (Computed from P26 data).
*   **Member Since**: "Member for 3 years".

### 2.2. CTA Design
*   **Sticky Footer (Mobile)**: "Contact Seller" buttons always visible.
*   **Contrast**: Primary Action (Message) in Blue, Secondary (Phone) in Green (or vice versa based on A/B).

### 2.3. Friction Reduction
*   **Login Wall**: Move Login requirement to *after* clicking "Message", but allow typing the message first (Draft message).
*   **Phone Reveal**: Allow revealing without full login? **Decision**: No, require at least OTP login to prevent scraping.

## 3. A/B Tests (Growth)
*   **Test 1**: "Message" vs "Make Offer" button text.
*   **Test 2**: Show "20 people viewed this today" (Urgency).
