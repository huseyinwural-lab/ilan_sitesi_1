<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The initial project was to build and harden a Kullanıcı Tasarım (UI Designer) module for an admin panel, focusing on a secure publish/rollback workflow and implementing operational telemetry and alerting.

However, during this session, the user initiated a major pivot, requesting a complete redesign and build-out of the corporate dashboard UI. The new requirements are based on a series of detailed PDF documents and images provided by the user, dictating a new navigation structure, page layouts, and component functionalities. The current focus is to implement this new UI design, following a specific sequence defined by the user.

**User's preferred language**: Turkish

**what currently exists?**
The application is a full-stack React/FastAPI/PostgreSQL app. While the original hardened backend for UI configuration management is still in place, the primary focus of this session was a massive overhaul of the frontend corporate dashboard.

-   **Backend:** The original robust backend for UI configuration, versioning, and publishing remains. To support the rapid frontend development, a new set of API endpoints under  has been created. **CRITICALLY, all of these new endpoints are currently mocked and return static, hardcoded data.** They do not interact with the database.
-   **Frontend:** The frontend has been significantly rebuilt according to the user's PDF specifications. The main navigation has been restructured into a new two-row header and a collapsible, accordion-style sidebar. New pages and components have been created for 'Özet' (Summary), 'İlanlar' (Listings), 'Mesajlar' (Messages), 'Müşteri Yönetimi' (Customer Management), 'Favoriler' (Favorites), and 'Raporlar' (Reports). The application UI now closely follows the user-provided designs.

**Last working item**:
-   **Last item agent was working:** Implementing the Danışman Takibi (Consultant Tracking) page. The agent had just finished creating the mock backend endpoint () and the corresponding Pydantic schema. The next step is to build the frontend component for this page.
-   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
-   **Agent Testing Done:** N
-   **Which testing method agent to use?** both. The backend endpoint should be tested with  to ensure it returns the mock data correctly. After the frontend component is built, the  should be used to verify the UI.
-   **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   **Issue 1: Mocked Backend for Corporate Dashboard (P1)**
    -   **Description:** The entire backend supporting the new corporate dashboard UI is mocked. All endpoints in  return hardcoded data. This was a deliberate choice to accelerate frontend development.
    -   **Next debug checklist:**
        1.  Prioritize with the user when to transition from mock data to a live database implementation.
        2.  For each module (Summary, Listings, Messages, etc.), replace the mock data generation with actual database queries (SELECT, JOIN, aggregate).
        3.  Create or update database tables and Alembic migrations as needed to support the new data structures.
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** The dashboard will become a dynamic, data-driven tool instead of a static prototype.
    -   **Status:** NOT STARTED
    -   **Is recurring issue?** N
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** both
    -   **Blocked on other issue:** None. This is a major upcoming work package.

**In progress Task List**:
-   **Task 1: Complete Danışman Takibi (Consultant Tracking) Page (P0)**
    -   **Where to resume:** Create the frontend component  to display the data from the newly created mock endpoint.
    -   **What will be achieved with this?** This will complete the next UI section in the sequence requested by the user.
    -   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** both
    -   **Blocked on something:** None.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
-   **Upcoming Tasks (P1):** (Following user's sequence for the UI build-out)
    1.  **Implement Satın Al (Purchase) Page:** Create the mock backend and frontend for the purchasing section as per user specifications.
    2.  **Implement Hesabım (My Account) Page:** Build out the My Account page and its various sub-sections, starting with mock data.

-   **Future Tasks (P2 & Backlog):**
    1.  **P2 - Connect Corporate Dashboard to Database:** Convert all mocked backend endpoints for the new dashboard to use real data from the PostgreSQL database. This is the highest priority future task.
    2.  **P2 - Alerting Channel Integration:** The original P0 task to integrate Slack, SMTP, and PagerDuty is blocked pending user action to provide secrets. This has been deprioritized by the user's pivot to UI work.
    3.  **P2 - Physical Deletion of Legacy Publish Endpoint:** Remove the deprecated  endpoint.
    4.  **Backlog - Master Data Import:** Implement the business logic in .
    5.  **Backlog - Theme Token Editor:** Build the UI for managing granular design tokens (colors, fonts).
    6.  **Backlog - Widget Template Library:** Create a library of pre-configured, reusable dashboard widget templates.

**Completed work in this session**
-   **Corporate Dashboard UI Overhaul (Frontend Prototype):**
    -   **Navigation:** Implemented a new two-row header and a collapsible accordion sidebar (, ) based on the user's design.
    -   **'Özet' (Summary) Page:** Created a page with summary statistics cards.
    -   **'İlanlar' (Listings) Page:** Created a listings page with filtering and a list view.
    -   **'Mesajlar' (Messages) Page:** Built a messages interface, including a requested read/unread status feature.
    -   **'Müşteri Yönetimi > Sözleşmeler' Page:** Created the contracts page.
    -   **'Favoriler' (Favorites) Page:** Created the favorites page with its sub-sections.
    -   **'Raporlar' (Reports) Page:** Created the reports page with its sub-sections.
    -   **Menu Adjustments:** Made menus collapsible and improved text visibility as requested. Removed 'Sanal Turlar' (Virtual Tours) from the menu.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
-   **Issue 1: Master Data Import Logic:** The service at  is a skeleton and requires full implementation. This is a known backlog item.
-   **Issue 2: Alerting Channel Integration:** The P0 task from the previous fork is blocked because it requires the user to provide secrets for Slack, SMTP, and PagerDuty. This task was superseded by the user's request for a UI overhaul and is now in the backlog.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
-   **Issue recurrence in previous fork**: Platform failure to inject  secret.
-   **Recurrence count:** 10+
-   **Status:** BLOCKED (Workaround in place: using  for all secret configurations). The agent must continue to rely on the  file.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Mock-First Development:** Creating mock backend endpoints that return static data to enable rapid, parallel development of the frontend UI without waiting for database implementation.
-   **PDF-Driven UI Implementation:** Translating visual designs and requirements from PDF documents directly into React components and page structures.
-   **Component-Based Architecture:** Using reusable React components (from  and custom-built) to construct the new UI.
-   **Config-driven UI:** The underlying principle that UI elements can be dynamically rendered based on configuration, which is still relevant for the header and other elements.
-   **Secure Publish Workflow:** The original hardened mechanism for publishing UI changes, which is still present in the backend but not the current focus of development.

**key DB schema**
No new database tables were created in this session. All new backend endpoints rely on Pydantic schemas for their response models but return hardcoded data, not data from the database. The original  and  tables remain.

**changes in tech stack**
No new third-party libraries were added. Development relied on the existing stack (React, FastAPI, PostgreSQL) and UI components from .

**All files of reference**
-   **New Backend Domain:**  (and all sub-files)
-   **New Frontend Pages:**  (and all  files within)
-   **New Frontend Components:** , , 
-   **User-Provided Artifacts:**
    -   
    -   
    -   Image of the desired header structure (from Chat Message #348)

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-   **Backend Mocking:** The most significant area for future work is to remove all mock data from  and replace it with live database queries.

**key api endpoints**
All new endpoints are prefixed with .
-   
-   
-   
-   
-    (multiple endpoints for different favorite types)
-    (multiple endpoints for different reports)
-    (recently added)

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   **PROJECT PIVOT:** The project's focus has completely shifted from backend hardening to a rapid frontend redesign based on user-provided PDFs. The original high-priority tasks from the handoff summary are now in the backlog.
-   **BACKEND IS MOCKED:** Be aware that the entire new corporate dashboard is a frontend prototype. All new backend endpoints under  return static, hardcoded data. Do not attempt to debug database queries for these endpoints, as there are none. The next major work package will be to implement the database logic.
-   **FOLLOW USER'S SEQUENCE:** The user has provided a clear, step-by-step sequence for building the UI. You must continue this sequence. The current task is the Danışman Takibi page, to be followed by Satın Al and Hesabım.
-   **COMMUNICATE IN TURKISH:** The user's primary language is Turkish. All communication must be in Turkish.

**documents and test reports created in this job**
No new final documents or test reports were generated in this session, as the agent was in a continuous loop of iterative development based on user feedback and never reached a  state.

**Credentials to test flow:**
-   **Admin:**  / 

**What agent forgot to execute**
The agent did not forget any tasks. It was redirected by the user to a completely new set of high-priority requirements (the UI redesign). The originally planned tasks (e.g., Alerting Integration) were implicitly deprioritized by the user and are correctly captured in the backlog.</analysis>
