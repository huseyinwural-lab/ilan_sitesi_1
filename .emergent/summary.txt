<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user wants to build a multi-country, multi-language classifieds platform admin panel. The project has evolved through multiple phases, each with detailed, locked-in requirements.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS (Locked Decisions):**

*   **Phase 1-6 (Completed):** Core Infrastructure, Business Logic, Stripe Integration, Refund Flow, Dealer Packages, Deployment Preparation.
*   **Phase T2 (Completed):** Advanced Pricing Engine.
*   **Phase P7.0 (Completed):** Stabilization - Hardening sprint focused on observability, API contract hardening, security guardrails, and performance validation.
*   **Phase P7.2 (Completed):** Admin UI Minimum Scope - Implemented the Frontend UI for managing Master Data entities (Attributes, Options, Vehicle Makes/Models).
*   **Data & Domain Modeling (Completed):**
    *   **Emlak (Real-Estate):** Standardized attributes to EU norms.
    *   **Vasıta (Vehicle):** Implemented a full Master Data Management (MDM) system.
    *   **Alışveriş (Shopping):** Implemented an Attribute System v2 using typed columns.
*   **Current Phase (P7.3 - Public UI Search Integration):** Integrate the new, performant Search API v2 into the public-facing frontend, including dynamic facets.

**User's preferred language**: Turkish. The next agent MUST respond in Turkish.

**what currently exists?**
The application is a sophisticated full-stack classifieds admin platform. The backend is stable, performant, and fully seeded with data. The initial blocker of an empty database was resolved by re-installing PostgreSQL and executing a corrected sequence of seeding scripts.

The **P7.0 Stabilization Phase** is complete, with the query plan audit passing successfully on a 10k-listing dataset.

The **P7.2 Admin UI Minimum Scope Phase** is also complete. This involved creating the necessary frontend React components for managing Attributes, Attribute Options, and Vehicle Makes/Models, along with adding the required backend API endpoints for Vehicle MDM. The new UI was tested by the testing agent and is functional.

All necessary planning and architecture documents for the next phase (P7.3) have been created as per the user's explicit instructions.

**Last working item**:
- **Last item agent was working:** The agent was kicking off **Phase P7.3 - Public UI Search Integration**. It has just completed the planning stage by creating all the required kickoff, architecture, and specification documents based on the user's detailed task list. The next step is to begin the implementation of the public-facing search UI.
- **Status**: NOT STARTED
- **Agent Testing Done**: N/A
- **Which testing method agent to use?**: frontend testing agent
- **User Testing Done**: N/A

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
- **Issue 1:** Minor Seed Data Gaps (P2 - LOW PRIORITY)

**Issues Detail:**
- **Issue 1:**
  - **Description:** The testing agent reported that some seed data is incomplete. Specifically: vehicle-related 'select' attributes are missing their corresponding options, and existing options only have English labels (missing Turkish/German). A dedicated  test user is also missing.
  - **Attempted fixes:** The agent created a script () to address the missing options but the other items remain.
  - **Next debug checklist:**
    1.  Modify  or a similar script to add Turkish and German labels (, ) to attribute options.
    2.  Modify  to create a user with the  role for testing RBAC scenarios more easily.
  - **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?**: Fixing this will improve the quality of test/demo data and allow for more thorough testing of localization and role-based access control features in the UI. It's not a blocker for P7.3 development.
  - **Status**: NOT STARTED
  - **Is recurring issue?**: N
  - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: backend
  - **Blocked on other issue**: None.

**In progress Task List**:
None.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
- **Upcoming Tasks:**
    - **P7.3: Public UI Search Integration (P0 - HIGHEST PRIORITY):**
        1.  **Facet Renderer:** Implement the frontend components to render different facet types (checkboxes for , sliders for , etc.) based on the Search v2 API response.
        2.  **URL State Management:** Ensure the user's filter selections are reflected in the URL as canonical query parameters to allow for shareable links and support SEO.
        3.  **UI Implementation:** Build the search results page, category browsing interface, and the filter sidebar.
        4.  **Performance Regression Test:** After implementation, run a performance check to ensure the UI integration has not negatively impacted the p95 latency of the search API.
    - **P7.2: Admin UI Visual QA (P2):** An optional, non-blocking task to perform a visual review of the recently completed Admin UI screens, focusing on RBAC display logic (disabled fields) and styling of inactive items.

- **Future Tasks:**
    - **Provider-Driven Master Data Sync:** Implement a recurring job to sync vehicle Make/Model data from an external provider.
    - **Alışveriş (Shopping) Dikeyi:** Fully flesh out the shopping vertical with more detailed attributes.
    - **V2 Roadmap:** Implement advanced features like dynamic rate limiting, ML-based abuse scoring, and self-service analytics.

**Completed work in this session**
- **Environment Recovery:** Successfully recovered from two separate environment resets by reinstalling PostgreSQL, re-initializing the database, and running all data seeding scripts.
- **Database Seeding:** Corrected the seed script execution order and created a new script to fix a gap in category creation, successfully populating the database with over 10,000 listings and all necessary master data.
- **P7.0 Stabilization Phase (COMPLETED):**
  - Executed the  script against the 10k dataset.
  - Confirmed all critical search queries use indexes ( / ), achieving sub-5ms latency and validating that no further index hardening is needed.
- **P7.2 Admin UI Minimum Scope (COMPLETED):**
  - **Backend:** Added CRUD API endpoints for Vehicle Makes and Models to .
  - **Frontend:** Implemented three new admin pages: , , and  for master data management.
  - **Testing:** Successfully tested the new frontend functionality using the .
- **Documentation:** Created extensive planning, architecture, and closure documents for phases P7.0, P7.2, and the kickoff of P7.3.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
The minor seed data gaps identified by the testing agent are listed in the All Pending/In progress Issue list.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
- **Issue recurrence in previous fork:** The entire environment, specifically the PostgreSQL service and its data, is prone to being reset between sessions. This occurred twice in the last session, forcing the agent to re-install PostgreSQL and re-run all database migrations and seed scripts from scratch.
- **Recurrence count:** 2
- **Status:** RESOLVED (for the session), but the underlying instability is a known risk.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Database Seeding Strategy:** A multi-step, ordered process is required to build the database state correctly. Dependencies between scripts (e.g., categories must exist before attributes are bound) are critical.
- **Frontend Master Data Management:** Implementation of CRUD interfaces in React for managing core business entities, respecting role-based access control (RBAC) by disabling UI elements.
- **API Extension:** Adding new endpoints to an existing FastAPI router to support new frontend functionality.

**key DB schema**
No changes were made to the database schema in this session.

**All files of reference**
- **Newly Created/Modified Code:**
  - : Extended with Vehicle MDM endpoints.
  - , , : New frontend pages.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- **The next phase is P7.3: Public UI Search Integration.** You must begin implementation based on the newly created architecture documents (, , ).
- **Environment Instability:** Be aware that the PostgreSQL database may be wiped. If you encounter database errors, the first step should be to check if the service is running and if data exists. You may need to re-run the entire seeding process as documented in the agent's history. The correct seeding order is critical.
- **Admin Credentials:** The default superadmin password discovered during the session is .
