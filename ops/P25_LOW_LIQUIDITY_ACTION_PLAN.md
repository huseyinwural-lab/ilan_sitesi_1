# P25: Low Liquidity Action Plan

## 1. Target: "Warm" Cities (High Demand, Low Supply)
Users are searching but finding 0-5 results. This is the biggest churn risk.

## 2. Actions

### 2.1. The "Fake it till you make it" (Aggregation)
*   **Expand Radius**: Default search radius 10km -> 50km for these cities.
*   **Cross-List**: Show listings from adjacent cities explicitly ("Nearby Recommendations").

### 2.2. Supply Injection (Seed Ops)
*   **Scrape & Call**: Identify dealers on other platforms in that city. Call them with "We have 50 buyers searching for X in your city, post for free."
*   **Ghost Listings**: (Ethical Line) Do NOT post fake listings.

### 2.3. User Retention
*   **"Save Search" Prompt**: If < 5 results, show "Email me when new listings appear" popup immediately.
