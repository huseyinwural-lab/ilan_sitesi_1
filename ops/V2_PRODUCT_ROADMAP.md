# V2 Product Roadmap (Strategic)

**Phase:** Future (Post-P7)

## 1. Dynamic Adaptive Limiting
-   **Concept:** Limits change automatically based on Server Load (CPU).
-   **Benefit:** Protects system during unpredictable non-abuse load spikes.

## 2. AI/ML Abuse Detection
-   **Concept:** Score users based on behavior patterns (not just counts).
-   **Model:** Train on P6 logs. Identify "Scraping" patterns vs "Buying" patterns.

## 3. Self-Service Analytics
-   **Feature:** Dealer Dashboard showing "My Limit Usage".
-   **Goal:** Reduce support tickets asking "Why was I blocked?".

## 4. Multi-Country Domain Scaling
-   **Arch:** Separate Database Shards per Region (EU, NA, APAC).
-   **Goal:** Compliance with strict Data Residency laws.

## 5. Billing Integration
-   **Feature:** Auto-upgrade Tier when Limit hit (Upsell opportunity).
